Copy the csv files to this folder and to the Theanos foler. Then run "convert_to_numpy_bias.py" here and "convert_to_numpyRAW.py" in the Theanos folder to generate the appropriate
datasets.


NNIncrementalTest.py

This is the basic implemented neural network code for part b) of the assignment. It runs on the test after every epoch and outputs a file. It also states the minimum
squared error for each epoch

pybrainMod.py

This is the basic neural network implemented through the pybrain library. Works similar to the previous file

Theanos

This is simply code from http://www.deeplearning.net/tutorial/ modified only slightly to take in our dataset and produce output files. This was used to make the submissions
on Kaggle.
